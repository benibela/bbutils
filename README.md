BButils [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/benibela/bbutils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benibela/bbutils)
=============
 
These units consist of important low-level functions missing in FreePascal. For example:

*    String and array view for efficient processing of slices of a string or array.
*    Various array functions (add, delete, search, prealloc, ...) and array lists.
*    Various string functions (pchar/ansistring, compare, split, search, convert html entities, ...). string builder for fast construction of strings.
*    Various date/time parsing/formatting functions, supporting years before 0 and after 65535, and timezones
*    Mathematical functions (gcd, primes, Bernoulli statistics, prime/euler-phi sieve...)
*    Stable sorting function for arbitrary sized data arrays
*    Automatical translation of with tr['marked strings'] and components
*    A Pascal template language which is "compiled" to Pascal (similar to the C preprocessor)
